Classes help in organizing and structuring code, making it easier to create and manipulate objects in a modular way.' },
        { question: 'What is an object in OOP?', answer: 'An object is an instance of a class that contains real data and interacts with other objects or the system. Objects have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that define their behavior. In OOP, objects communicate with each other to perform various tasks in a system.' },
        { question: 'What is inheritance?', answer: 'Inheritance is a key concept in OOP that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchical relationship between classes.' },
        { question: 'What is polymorphism?', answer: 'Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In OOP, polymorphism allows one function or method to behave differently depending on the object that invokes it, enabling flexibility and extending functionality in systems.' },
        { question: 'What is encapsulation?', answer: 'Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components, providing control over how data is modified or accessed.' },
        { question: 'What is abstraction?', answer: 'Abstraction in OOP is the concept of hiding complex implementation details from the user and exposing only the necessary parts of an object’s functionality. It simplifies interaction with objects by focusing on what they do rather than how they do it, making systems easier to manage and use.' },
        { question: 'What is method overloading?', answer: 'Method overloading is a feature in OOP that allows multiple methods to have the same name but differ in parameters (type, number, or both). This enables the same method to be used for different purposes, enhancing flexibility and readability in the code.' },
        { question: 'What is method overriding?', answer: 'Method overriding allows a subclass to provide its specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is used when a subclass needs to change or extend the behavior of an inherited method while maintaining the same method signature.' },
        { question: 'What is a constructor?', answer: 'A constructor is a special type of method used to initialize objects in OOP. It is automatically invoked when an object is created and can be used to set initial values for object attributes or to perform setup tasks. Constructors can also be overloaded to offer multiple ways to initialize an object.' },
