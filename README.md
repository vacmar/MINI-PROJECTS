# 2048 Game Project

This project implements the classic 2048 game using Python and Tkinter. The game allows users to merge tiles with the same value to reach the goal of 2048, or continue to achieve even higher scores.

# Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed with Tkinter for an interactive user experience.

Random Tile Generation: Tiles with values of 2 or 4 appear randomly on the grid.

Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to move tiles up, down, left, or right.

Score Tracking: Displays the current score during the game.

Game Over Detection: Alerts the user when no moves are possible.

Responsive Design: Automatically adapts to grid updates during gameplay.

# How to Run the Game:

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter module (comes pre-installed with Python).

# Steps to Run:

Clone or download the repository containing the project files.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the 2048.py file is located.

Run the game by executing the following command:

python 2048.py

# How to Play:

Launch the game by following the steps above.

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the grid:

Up Arrow: Move tiles up.

Down Arrow: Move tiles down.

Left Arrow: Move tiles left.

Right Arrow: Move tiles right.

When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value.

The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048.

The game ends when no more moves are possible.

# Code Overview:

The 2048.py file contains the entire implementation of the game, including:

Initialization of the game grid.

Handling user input for moving tiles.

Logic for merging tiles and updating the grid.

Game over detection and score tracking.

GUI setup using Tkinter.

# Tic Tac Toe Game Project

This project is a human-vs-human implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, built using Python and Tkinter. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

# Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed using Tkinter for an interactive gameplay experience.

Turn-Based Play: Alternates turns between two players.

Win Detection: Alerts the players when someone wins.

Draw Detection: Identifies when the game ends in a draw.

Reset Functionality: Allows players to restart the game easily.

# How to Run the Game:

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter module (comes pre-installed with Python).

# Steps to Run:

Clone or download the repository containing the project files.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the tic_tac_toe.py file is located.

Run the game by executing the following command:

python tic_tac_toe.py

# How to Play: 

Launch the game by following the steps above.

The first player places an X, and the second player places an O.

Players take turns clicking on empty spaces on the grid to place their marks.
