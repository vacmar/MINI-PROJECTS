#2048 Game Project

This project implements the classic 2048 game using Python and Tkinter. The game allows users to merge tiles with the same value to reach the goal of 2048, or continue to achieve even higher scores.

Features

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed with Tkinter for an interactive user experience.

Random Tile Generation: Tiles with values of 2 or 4 appear randomly on the grid.

Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to move tiles up, down, left, or right.

Score Tracking: Displays the current score during the game.

Game Over Detection: Alerts the user when no moves are possible.

Responsive Design: Automatically adapts to grid updates during gameplay.

How to Run the Game

Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter module (comes pre-installed with Python).

Steps to Run

Clone or download the repository containing the project files.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the 2048.py file is located.

Run the game by executing the following command:

python 2048.py

How to Play

Launch the game by following the steps above.

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the grid:

Up Arrow: Move tiles up.

Down Arrow: Move tiles down.

Left Arrow: Move tiles left.

Right Arrow: Move tiles right.

When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling their value.

The goal is to create a tile with the value 2048.

The game ends when no more moves are possible.

Code Overview

The 2048.py file contains the entire implementation of the game, including:

Initialization of the game grid.

Handling user input for moving tiles.

Logic for merging tiles and updating the grid.

Game over detection and score tracking.

GUI setup using Tkinter.

Example Output

Below is an example of the 2048 game's graphical interface during gameplay:

+------+------+------+------+

|      |  2   |      |      |

+------+------+------+------+

|      |      |      |      |

+------+------+------+------+

|      |      |  2   |      |

+------+------+------+------+

|      |      |      |      |

+------+------+------+------+

The numbers represent tiles, and the user can merge them by moving in any direction.
