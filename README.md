# 2048 Game Project
This project implements the classic 2048 game using Python and Tkinter. The game allows users to merge tiles with the same value to reach the goal of 2048, or continue to achieve even higher scores.

# Features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Designed with Tkinter for an interactive user experience.

Random Tile Generation: Tiles with values of 2 or 4 appear randomly on the grid.

Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to move tiles up, down, left, or right.

Score Tracking: Displays the current score during the game.

Game Over Detection: Alerts the user when no moves are possible.

Responsive Design: Automatically adapts to grid updates during gameplay.

# How to Run the Game:

Python 3.x installed on your system.

Tkinter module (comes pre-installed with Python).

# Steps to Run:

Clone or download the repository containing the project files.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where the 2048.py file is located.

Run the game by executing the following command:

# How to Play:

Launch the game by following the steps above.

Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the grid:

Up Arrow: Move tiles up.
